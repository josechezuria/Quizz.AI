📚 quizz.ai – AI-Powered Quiz Generator
quizz.ai is a full-stack quiz application that dynamically generates unique questions using AI and tracks user sessions without requiring a login.

This project is a complete rebuild of my first-ever app, now powered by:

🧠 AI-generated questions via API

🍪 Cookie-based session tracking (no accounts needed)

🔗 Custom-built API with a relational PostgreSQL database

💻 Vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, Express, jQuery, SASS

The goal is to create an intelligent, fast, and personal quiz experience while learning how to:

Build and consume AI APIs

Design scalable backend architecture

Practice database normalization and relationships

Build in public and learn from feedback
