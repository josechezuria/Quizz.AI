📚 quizz.ai – AI-Powered Quiz Generator
quizz.ai is a full-stack quiz application that dynamically generates unique questions using AI and tracks user sessions — all without requiring a login.

This project is a complete rebuild of my first-ever app (see the original in the v1 folder), now powered by:

🧠 AI-generated questions via API

🍪 Cookie-based session tracking (no accounts needed)

🔗 A custom-built API backed by a relational PostgreSQL database

💻 Built with Vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Axios, jQuery, and SASS

🎯 Goals
Learn to build and consume AI APIs

Design scalable backend architecture

Practice database normalization and table relationships

Build in public and grow through community feedback
